<h2>  South Indian cuisine usually encompasses the five Southern states of  <u> <b>Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Telangana, and Kerala </u> </b></h2>
 <p>
Both the geography and cultural influence of the South has an influence on the region's cuisine.As with most countries, there are large regional
 differences and each state's cuisine can vary greatly even within a specific state.There are typically vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes for all
 five states.Additionally, all regions have typical main dishes, snacks, light meals, desserts, and drinks that are well-known in their respective 
 region. <br>
             South India has a hot, humid climate and all its states are coastal. Rainfall is abundant and so is the supply of fresh fruit,vegetable
and rice.Andhra Pradesh produces fiery Andhra cuisine which is largely vegetarian yet has a huge range of seafood in its coastal areas.
Tamilnadu has Chettinad cuisine, perhaps the fieriest of all Indian food. This style too is largely vegetarian.
<br>
                          From Kerala comes Malabari cooking, with its repertoire of tasty seafood dishes. Hyderabad is the home of the Nizams 
(rulers of Hyderabad) and regal Nizami food rich and flavorful with tastes ranging from spicy to sour to sweet. Hyderabadi food is full of nuts,
 dried fruits, and expensive spices like saffron.
