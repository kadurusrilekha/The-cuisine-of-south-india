<p>For a healthy breakfast/snack option, Sarva Pindi is an excellent choice as it is cooked with at least one component of each stage of the food 
pyramid. It is a savoury pancake made of rice flour, chana dal, peanuts and chilli. It is cooked in a deep, round shaped pan and to preserve the 
sanctity of the recipe, it is pertinent to make holes in the rolled out dough mixture before cooking it. It is also called Ginne Appa owing to its 
preparation. </p>

 <p>Who doesn’t love some crispy, deep-fried snack every now and then? Sakinalu is one of those grubs that Indians have been perfecting over the
 years in various parts of India and giving it different names like murkku, chakli etc. But Sakinalu is not the same as the aforementioned items 
 although they do share a slightly similar preparation. Its two chief ingredients are rice and sesame seeds and is devoid of spices, therefore
 making it a mild snack that is also easy to prepare. It is mainly made during the festival of Sankranti or is offered during marriage.

<p> With a crispy exterior, Garijalu also called Kajjikaya has a sweet filling consisting of dry grated coconut, sugar and hints of cardamom. It is
 deep-fried and its shape as you can see, resembles Karanji; a sweet dish of Maharashtra. The crispy shell is made of maida and rolled out into 
 circles, which is then folded after the filling is stuffed and the shape resembles a half moon. Although the origin of Garijalu is not known and 
 has been shared between different states of India, the people of Telangana have been enjoying making these for generations over the years.</p>

<p>A quick fix for that morning where you’re too sick to cook or you’re craving for Rasam but you are lazy to carry out the entire process of making
; Pachi Pulusu will come to your rescue. So the basic difference between Pachi Pulusu and Rasam is that the former has very little “cooking” 
involved and uses the gas only to temper the seasoning. The commonality is their ingredients. While tamarind requires to be boiled for rasam,
 it only needs to be soaked in lukewarm water for this dish. The simplicity of the dish sure helps our lazy selves to have wholesome food once 
 in while! </p>

<p> Finally a non-vegetarian dish for the meat-lovers! . As Telangana cuisine is well-known for its spices,
this dish incorporates succulent pieces of mutton into a thick gravy that is loaded with locally grown spices and cooked over low flame for
hours so the meat can truly absorb the essence of the curry. It is usually eaten with chapathis, rice or dosa.</p>
