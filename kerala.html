<p>As cute as its name sounds, puttu is a cylindrical steamed rice cake cooked with coconut shavings. This is an extremely popular breakfast item and staple food of Kerala. This Kerala food item is usually served with kadala curry which is essentially black chickpeas but can be eaten in whichever way it tastes good!

<p>Ask anybody from Kerala what their favourite dish is from back home and they will swear by appam and stew! I think it's justified for them to do so because appam is just something that seems to be a revolution in the food world. It is a rice pancake with a soft and thick centre and a crispy, paper thin outside. No matter what you eat it with, appam will increase that dish's taste value beyond hundred! However, it is usually paired with a southern style stew where chunks of any kind of meat in smothered in a silky, rich, dreamy coconut curry which will leave you sad when it finishes.

<p>Idiyappam is basically made of rice flour, water and salt. Numerous strands of vermicelli are entwined together to make this version of an appam. Also known as noolappam, this Kerala dish can be paired with any curry and still taste great!

<p>You can never go wrong with chicken fry! You take a chicken which is the favourite meat of 99% of the entire population and fry it! Who doesn't love fried stuff?! So, this version of a chicken fry is something that is out of this world. Served on a banana leaf, the chicken is fried with onion, garlic, chilli, vinegar and coriander. The fiery taste of this popular Kerala food item on your tongue will leave you craving for more!

 If you are in Kerala and you miss out on the phenomenal prawn curry, then your trip will remain incomplete.  It's amazing how simple components in a dish come together to make something so beautiful. This traditional prawn curry is sprinkled with chilli, salt, pepper and then dipped in lots of coconut milk, jaggery and then finally finished with curry leaves. The humble coconut (in all its kinds) notches up the dish to another level on a whole!
